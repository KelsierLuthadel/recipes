# Garam Masala (Kashmiri)

![Garam Masala](resources/garam-masala.jpg)

*Garam masala is one of the keys to Northern Indian, Moghul and Pakistani cooking. Literally meaning hot (garam) mixture of spices (masala), it is used to perk up dishes towards the end of their cooking.*

*This is an authentic Kashmiri garam masala, where the emphasis is on the aromatics rather than the heat.*

*The spices should be stored in a cool dark place, away from any sunlight as this will fade the colour and taste. Once stored the spices should ideally be left for about a month to mature, and used within six months.*

**Note:** spoon measurements here are heaped, rather than level.

**Yield:** 200 grams

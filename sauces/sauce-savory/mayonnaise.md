# Mayonnaise

*If your mayonnaise separates instead of remaining suspended in an emulsion then leave the mayonnaise out at room temperature for 30 minutes. Using a high speed mixer, beat in half a teaspoon of mustard. Put a spoon full of warm water in a bowl, and beat in a spoonful of the broken mayonnaise, adding it bit by bit and beating at high speed.  The mixture should foam. Add a second spoon of the broken mayonnaise, then a third. You should see the sauce thickening, and taking. Now using a small ladle, very gradually incorporate the rest of the broken mayonnaise into the new mixture.*

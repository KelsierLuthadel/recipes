*One of the delights of this  luscious  dessert is that all the elements can be prepared a few hours in advance.*

**Serves:** 10

## Ingredients
- 1 quantity freshly made [choux paste](../../baking/pastry/choux-pastry.md)
- eggwash (1 egg yolk mixed with 1 tablespoon milk)

### Filling
- 1 quantity vanilla ice cream

### Chocolate sauce
- 250 grams dark bitter chocolate
- 200 ml milk
- 3 tablespoons double cream
- 40 grams caster sugar
- 30 grams butter (diced)

## Method
### To make the choux buns
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
1. Line a baking sheet with greaseproof paper.
1. Put the choux paste into a piping bag fitted with a 1 cm plain nozzle and pipe out about 40 puffs, 3 cm in diameter. Pipe these out in staggered rows.
1. Brush the pastries with eggwash and bake in the oven for 20 minutes until dry and crisp on the outside, but still soft on the inside.
1. As soon as they are cooked, transfer them to a wire rack and leave until cold.
Using a serrated knife, cut across the top one-fifth of each puff, leaving a hinge to make a lid.
1. Set the puffs aside.

### To make the chocolate sauce
1. Chop the chocolate and place in a heatproof bowl over a pan of hot water to melt gently, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon.
1. Put the milk, cream and sugar into a saucepan and bring to the boil, whisking continuously.
1. Take off the heat, and whilst still whisking, pour on the melted chocolate, then return to the heat.
1. Still whisking, let the sauce bubble over a medium heat.
1. Turn off the heat and whisk in the pieces of butter, one at a time.
1. Pass the sauce through a chinois or fine-meshed conical sieve into a bowl.
1. Cover with cling film and keep warm in a bain-marie.

### To serve
1. Generously fill the choux buffs with ice cream, then reposition the lids.
1. Serve in glass dishes.
1. Pour on some of the chocolate sauce and serve the profiteroles immediately.
1. Serve the rest of the chocolate sauce in a sauceboat.

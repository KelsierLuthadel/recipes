# Parcels of poached pears

![Name](resources/parcels.jpg)

*Crisp on the outside, meltingly soft within, these hot little parcels are delectable. They can be prepared several hours in advance, up to the stage where you cook them, and the pears can be poached a day ahead.*

**Serves:** 6

## Ingredients
- 500 grams caster sugar
- 8 cloves
- 4 perfectly ripe pears
- 300 grams [puff pasty](../../baking/pastry/puff-pastry.md)
- 6 [crêpes](../../desert/crepes/crepes.md) (20 cm in diameter)
- 8 fresh mint leaves (finely chopped)
- groundnut oil (to fry)
- granulated sugar (to dust)

## Method
### To cook the pears
1. Put 500 ml of water into a saucepan with the sugar and cloves and bring to the boil over a gentle heat.
1. Keep the syrup at a bare simmer (90°C).
1. Peel, halve and core the pears, then add to the syrup and poach gently for 10 minutes.
1. Remove from the heat and leave the pears to cool in the syrup.
1. Once cool, place in the fridge.

### To make the parcels
1. On a lightly floured surface, roll out half the pastry as thinly as possible, no more than 2 mm thick.
1. Transfer to a baking sheet lined with greaseproof paper and refrigerate.
1. Roll out the remaining pastry the same way, then layer on the other rolled-out sheet in the fridge, with a sheet of greaseproof paper between.

### To assemble
1. Drain the pears and cut into 2 cm dice.
1. Cut the crêpes into pieces just big enough to wrap the pear pieces.
1. Roll each pear dice in snipped mint, then wrap in a crêpe piece.
Cut the pastry into 8 cm squares, and place a crêpe-covered piece of pear in the centre of each pastry square, then bring the sides of the square up over the top and pinch the edges together to seal.
1. Refrigerate for 10 minutes.
1. Heat the oil in a heavy saucepan to 170°C.
1. Cook the parcels in batches of 8 - 10 at a time in the hot oil for 4 - 5 minutes, until nutty brown in colour and crisp.
1. Drain on kitchen paper; keep hot while cooking the rest.
1. Serve the little parcels, hot, dusted with granulated sugar.

*These classic French breakfast pastries should be served with a steaming cup of hot chocolate.*

**Yield:** 30

## Ingredients
- 1.1 kg [croissant dough](../baking/pastry/croissant-dough.md)
- 400 grams [crème pâtissière](../baking/cremes/creme-patissiere.md) (substituting half the flour with custard powder)
- eggwash (1 egg yolk mixed with 1 tablespoon milk)
- 250 grams sultanas
- 100 grams caster sugar
- 50 ml dark rum

## Method
### For the sultanas
1. Put 200 ml water in a saucepan and add the sugar, sultanas and rum.
1. Slowly bring to the boil over a low heat and let bubble gently for 2 minutes.
1. Remove from the heat and leave to stand for 2 hours.
1. Drain the sultanas throughly just before using.

### For the dough
1. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a rectangle about 65 x 35 cm, 4 mm thick.
1. Trim the edged with a chef's knife, then use a palette knife to spread the crème pâtissière evenly over the dough, leaving a 1 cm margin free all round.
1. Scatter the sultanas over the crème pâtissière and brush the pastry edges with eggwash.

### Make the pains aux raisins
1. Working away from you, roll the pastry rectangle into a sausage shape.
1. Place on a baking sheet and put in the freezer for 30 - 45 minutes.
1. Using a very sharp knife, cut the pastry sausage into 2 cm thick rounds and place them cut side down on a baking sheet.

### To bake
1. Preheat the oven to 170°C.
1. Bake the pains aux raisins for 12 minutes, then transfer immediately to a wire rack with a palette knife.

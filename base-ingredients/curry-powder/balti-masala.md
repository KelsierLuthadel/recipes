# Balti masala

![Balt Masala](resources/balti-masala.jpg)

*The amount of masala you use depends on your taste. For a spicy dish you should use about 2 level teaspoons per portion. For a mild dish you should use only 1 level teaspoon per portion.*

*The spices should be stored in a cool dark place, away from any sunlight as this will fade the colour and taste. Once stored the spices should ideally be left for about a month to mature, and used within six months.*

**Note:** spoon measurements here are heaped, rather than level.

**Yield:** 200 grams

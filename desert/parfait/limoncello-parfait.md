## Method
### To make the parfait
1. Mix the egg, egg yolks sugar, lemon zest and lemon juice in a heatproof bowl, then set over a pan of simmering water, making sure that the bottom of the pan does not touch the water in any way. 
1. Whisk the mixture until it reaches 80-85°C.
1. Immediately take the bowl off the pan and continue to whisk until the mixture cools to 20°C, which will take about 10 minutes.
1. Meanwhile, soak the gelatine in cold water to cover.
1. Heat one-third of the limoncello in a small pan, then remove from the heat.
1. Drain the gelatine and squeeze out any excess water.
1. Add the gelatine to the hot limoncello, stirring to dissolve.
1. Let the limoncello cool slightly, then mix in the remaining limoncello.
1. Lightly whisk this into the cooled egg and lemon mixture.
1. In a separate bowl, whip the creams together to a ribbon consistency, then fold into the lemon mixture, using a rubber spatula.
1. Place 12 metal 5 cm rings, 3.5 cm high on a tray and fill with the parfait mixture.
1. Place in the freezer for 2 - 3 hours.

### To make the topping
1. Select 150 grams of the most perfect raspberries, halve them and set aside.
1. Purée the remaining berries with the sugar in a food processor for 1 minute, then pass through a chinois or fine-meshed conical sieve into a bowl, cover and refrigerate.

### To assemble
1. Briefly warm the outside of each ring using a blowtorch or a hot tea towel and release the parfait onto a serving plate.
1. Using a teaspoon dipped in hot water, scoop out a little from the middle of each one, making a hollow.
1. Fill with raspberries, spoon on some coulis, add a mint sprig and serve immediately.

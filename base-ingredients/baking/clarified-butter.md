# Clarified butter (Beurre clarifié)

*Clarified butter is milk fat rendered from butter to separate the milk solids and water from the butterfat. Typically, it is produced by melting butter and allowing the different components to separate by density. The water evaporates, some solids float to the surface and are skimmed off, and the remainder of the milk solids sink to the bottom and are left behind when the butter fat (which would then be on top) is poured off. It has a higher smoke point than regular butter, and is therefore preferred in some cooking applications, such as sautéing.*

*This is used for emulsified sauces like hollandaise*

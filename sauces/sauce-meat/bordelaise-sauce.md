*This wonderful sauce looks as good as it tastes. It is delicious with any cut of beef, especially entrec√¥te, rib and sirloin. Remember to soak the beef marrow in advance.*

1. Drain the beef marrow and cut it into small pieces. 
1. Place in a small saucepan, cover with a little cold water and salt lightly.

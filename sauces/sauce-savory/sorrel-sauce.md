# Sorrel sauce

![Sorrel sauce](resources/sorrel-sauce.png)

*With its hint of acidity, this sauce is ideal for serving with fish cakes or pan-fried lamb chops. A few shredded mint leaves added to the sauce just before serving intensifies the taste of the sorrel and gives the sauce a more rounded flavour.*

*This sauce can be made into a foam, or simply poured.*

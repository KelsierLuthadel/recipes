*Eisacktaler Weinsuppe*

*From Eisacktaler in the Italian Valle d'Isarco - the extreme eastern part of the Alps - comes this heart-warming and delightful soup. There as as many people speak German as they do Italian, thus the name 'wine soup', a good example of the influence neighbouring countries have on the Italian regions and their food.*

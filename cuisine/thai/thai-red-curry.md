*Gaeng phed gai*

*The chilli paste that is the basis of this dish has a superb flavour and will come in useful in all sorts of spicy dishes, so it is worth making in quantity.*

*It is worth taking the extra time and effort to pound all the herbs and spices using a mortar and pestle, as this will release their fragrances perfectly.*

**Serves:** 4-6

1. Add the oil to the paste a little at a time and blend in well.
1. Transfer the paste to a clean jar and refrigerate until ready to use.

### To make the curry
1. Pour half the coconut milk into a large heavy pan.
1. Gently bring to the boil, stirring all the time until the milk separates, then reduce the heat.
1. Add 2 tablespoons of the red curry paste, stir to mix, and cook for a few minutes to allow the flavours to develop.
1. The sauce should begin to thicken and will need to be stirred frequently to prevent it from sticking to the pan, add a little more coconut milk if necessary.
1. Add the chicken, fish sauce and sugar.
1. Fry for 3 - 5 minutes until the chicken changes colour, stirring constantly to prevent it from sticking.
1. Add the rest of the coconut milk, with the bamboo shoots and kaffir lime leaves.

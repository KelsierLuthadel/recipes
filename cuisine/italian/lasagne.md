**For the meat sauce**

1. Season with salt and pepper and cook for a further 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Pour in the wine, stir well and cook for about 3 minutes to allow the alcohol to evaporate. 
1. Add the passata and tomato purée, lower the heat to a bare simmer and continue to cook for 1 hour, uncovered until you get a beautiful rich sauce. 
1. After about 30 minutes, taste for seasoning.

**For the béchamel**
1. Melt the butter in a small, heavy based saucepan over a low heat, and then add the flour. 
1. Stir with a whisk, and cook gently for 2-3 minutes to make a white roux.
1. Pour the cold milk on to the roux, whisking as you do so, and bring to the boil over a medium heat, whisking continuously.
1. When the sauce comes to the boil, lower the heat and simmer gently for about 10 minutes, stirring frequently.
1. Season to taste with freshly ground salt and pepper. 
1. Add about 1/4 a teaspoon of freshly ground nutmeg if you wish, and pass through a fine-meshed conical sieve.
1. Stir in half of the Parmesan and all of the pesto.

**To assemble**
1. Spread a quarter of the béchamel over the bottom of a deep oven-proof dish measuring 30 x 25 cm and lay about 4 lasagne sheets on top, trimming the pasta to fit the dish. 
1. Spread half of the meat sauce over the lasagne then top with a third of the remaining béchamel sauce.
1. Lay four more sheets on top and cover with the remaining meat sauce.
1. Spread half of the remaining béchamel on top, making sure all the pasta sheets are covered.
1. Sprinkle with the remaining Parmesan and scatter over the cubed butter.
1. Scatter over four turns of the pepper mill over the lasagne.
1. Place on the bottom shelf of the oven for 30 minutes, then place in the middle of the oven and increase the temperature to 200°C / 180°C fan for a further 15 minutes until golden and crispy all over.
1. Once ready, leave the lasagne to rest for 5 - 10 minutes, this will make it easier to cut and serve as the pasta layers will hold together.

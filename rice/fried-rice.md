# Fried rice

![Fried rice](resources/fried-rice.jpg)

*In China, fried rice is eaten as a 'filler' at the end of a dinner party. It is not eaten with other dishes in place of steamed rice. Although fried rice is common in Chinese restaurants, it is frequently incorrectly cooked.*

- *The cooked rice should be thoroughly cool before frying, preferably cold. Once cooled, much of the moisture in the rice evaporates, allowing the oil to coat the dry grains and keep them from sticking.*
- *Never cook the egg before adding to the rice, this will make it tough and dry.*
- *Always make sure the oil is hot enough before adding the rice, or it will saturate the rice making it greasy and heavy.**

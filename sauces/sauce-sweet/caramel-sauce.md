## Ingredients
- 80 ml water
- 100 grams sugar
- 500 ml double cream

1. Pour the water into a large saucepan and add the sugar. 
1. Set over a low heat until the sugar has completely melted and is beginning to boil.

1. Pass the sauce through a conical strainer into a bowl and keep it in a cool place. 
1. Stir the sauce from time to time to prevent a skin from forming.

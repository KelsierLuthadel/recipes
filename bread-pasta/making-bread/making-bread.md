# Making bread

There is nothing quite like the tantalising aroma of freshly baked bread, taking that first bite through the delicate crust into the warm soft fluffy body. Making bread this fine however, is an art usually held dear to the artisan baker. I'd like to share with you a few time honoured methods to ensure that your bread comes out perfect every time.

## Sticky dough
If you mix the dough with your hands then expect it to be sticky. The biggest mistake most people make is to add more flour to the dough, or to the table when kneading. This will make the finished dough very dense and difficult to eat. If a recipe calls for 350 grams of flour, then 350 grams of flour is all that is needed.

Apply a thin dusting of flour to the surface you are working on and knead the dough as the recipe states. If you find that the dough is becoming too sticky, then add a thin layer of olive oil to your hands and continue to knead the dough as usual. 

## Kneading
The longer you knead the dough, the better the resulting bread will be so expect to knead the dough for at least 15 minutes. You will know when the dough is ready as it will have a sheen to it, and if you hold the dough up it will not lose its shape or fall apart. You will require a little bit of effort to tear the dough apart. 

## Proving
After the dough has been kneaded to perfection, it will need to rest somewhere warm to prove. This will generally take about an hour or so, afterwards the dough will be more pliable and have doubled in size. When leaving the dough to prove, cover it with a damp tea towel, which will stop the air interacting with the dough and forming a skin which prevents  the dough from rising successfully.

After the  dough has proven, it will need to be knocked back. During the proving process, the dough will trap tiny pockets of air which need to be expelled. Simply punch down in the middle of the dough to release the air and fold the dough back on itself. Repeat this a couple of times and the dough is ready.

Some bread recipes, such as the baguette will call for multiple proving stages. Knock back the dough and cover again with a damp tea towel, then put the dough back in a warm place to prove again.

## Weighing water
A lot of bakers like their recipes to be exact, and measuring water in a jug is hit and miss when you are trying to get exact quantities. So it is common for bakers to weigh water rather than measure it, and this technique really is simple. 1 gram of water will equal 1 ml of water, so if the recipe calls for 225 ml of water then weigh out 225 grams and you will have exactly 225 ml of water.

## Pre-ferment
A lot of bread recipes will use yeast which, during the proving process will react with sugar and begin to ferment. This produces carbon dioxide and creates a light, airy texture and enhances the flavour of the bread. A lot of bakers, especially French bakers will use a longer fermentation process which vastly increases the flavour of the bread. Quite often a batch of bread dough will be kept aside in a warm place to be added to the next days dough. This batch of dough is known as poolish, which is the French word for Polish, a hint to where the method originated.

To create a poolish for a single batch of bread, take about 28% of the flour from the bread recipe and add to it an equal weight of water, and 28% of the yeast required. 

Example
If a recipe calls for:
- 350 grams flour
- 225 grams water
- 7 grams yeast

Then the poolish will consist of
- 100 grams flour
- 100 grams water
- 2 grams yeast

The final bread ingredients (without the poolish) will consist of
- 250 grams flour
- 125 grams water
- 5 grams yeast

While this sounds very complicated, once you get the hang of it, you will rely on the benefits of using poolish to create wonderful tasting breads.

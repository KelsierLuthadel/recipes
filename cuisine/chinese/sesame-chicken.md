# Chicken with sesame seeds

![Name](resources/sesame-chicken.jpg)

*This is a version of the fragrant Sichuan dish popularly known as 'Strange taste chicken'  or bang-bang chicken because it incorporates so many flavours, being hot, spicy, sour, sweet and salty all at the same time. It is both delicious as a hot dish and equally enjoyable served at room temperature. The sesame seeds add a crunchy texture which contrasts nicely with the tender chicken meat.*

**Serves:** 4

## Ingredients
- 225 grams boneless chicken breasts (skinned)
- 1 egg white
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons cornflour
- 150 ml groundnut oil
- 1 tablespoon white sesame seeds

**Sauce** 
- 1 teaspoon dark soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon cider or black rice vinegar
- ½ teaspoon chilli bean sauce
- ½ teaspoon sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 2 teaspoons dry sherry or rice wine
- ½ teaspoon Sichuan peppercorns (roasted and ground)
- 2 teaspoons spring onions (chopped)

## Method
1. Cut the chicken breasts into fine shreds of about 6 cm long, or into chunks.
1. Combine the chicken with the egg white, salt and cornflour in a small bowl and refrigerate for about 20 minutes.
1. Heat the oil in a wok or large frying pan until it is moderately hot.
1. Add the chicken mixture and stir-fry it quickly in the oil to keep it from sticking.
1. Cook until the chicken turns white, which will take about 1 minute if using shreds, and 3 - 4 minutes if using chunks.
1. Drain the chicken in a colander, reserving 1 tablespoon of the oil.
1. Clean the wok and add the reserved oil.
1. Re-heat the wok until it is hot and add the sesame seeds.
1. Stir fry the sesame seeds for 1 minute, or until they are slightly brown.
1. Add the sauce ingredients and bring to the boil.
1. Return the cooked chicken to the pan and stir-fry the mixture for another 2 minutes, coating the pieces thoroughly with the sauce and sesame seeds.
1. Serve at once or leave to cool and serve at room temperature.

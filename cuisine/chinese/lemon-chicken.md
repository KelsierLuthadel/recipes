![Name](resources/lemon-chicken.jpg)

*The Hong Kong Chinese have made a speciality of chicken cooked with lemon. The tart yet delicately sweet lemon sauce goes very well indeed with the delicate flavour of chicken. *

**Serves:** 4

## Ingredients
- 225 grams chicken breasts (skinned)
- 1 egg white
- 2 teaspoons cornflour
- 70 ml groundnut oil

**Sauce**  
- 70 ml Chinese chicken stock
- 1½ tablespoons lemon juice(freshly squeezed)
- 2 teaspoons sugar
- 2 teaspoons light soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons dry sherry or rice wine
- ½ teaspoon garlic (finely chopped)
- 1 dried red chilli
- 1 teaspoon cornflour (blended with 1 teaspoon water)


## Method
1. Cut the chicken into strips, about 7 cm long.
1. Combine the chicken strips with the egg white and cornflour in a bowl, and put it in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes.
1. Heat the oil in a wok or deep frying-pan until it is moderately hot.
1. Add the chicken strips and stir them quickly in the oil to keep them from sticking.
1. Cook the strips until they turn white, stirring continuously (this will take about a minute).
1. Drain the breasts immediately in a colander.
1. Wipe the wok clean and re-heat it.
1. Add all the sauce ingredients except for the cornflour mixture.
1. Bring it to the boil over a high heat and then add the cornflour mixture.
1. Simmer for 1 minute.
1. Return the chicken strips to the sauce and stir-fry them long enough to coat them all well with the sauce.
1. Turn onto a platter and serve at once.

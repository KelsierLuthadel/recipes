- half an onion (very finely chopped)
- 1 tablespoon coriander (freshly chopped)
- half a teaspoon of ground turmeric
- half a teaspoon of salt
- 3 tablespoons melted butter

## Method
1. Mix the flours, chopped chilli, onion and coriander with the ground turmeric and salt in a large bowl.
1. Stir in 1 tablespoon of the melted butter.
1. Mix in enough water to make a pliable, soft dough.
1. Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and knead it until smooth, then place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with cling film and leave to rest for 1 hour.
1. Pre-heat the oven to a low 100Â°C.
1. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface.
1. Divide into 4 equal pieces and shape into balls.
1. Roll out each ball of dough into a thick round, about 15 cm in diameter.
1. Heat a griddle pan over a medium heat for a few minutes.
1. Brush both sides of one rot with a little melted butter and add it to the griddle and cook for about 2 minutes, turning after 1 minute.
1. Brush the roti with a little more of the melted butter again and slide it onto a plate and keep warm in the pre-heated oven.
1. Cook the remaining rotis the same way.

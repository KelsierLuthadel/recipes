1. Gently heat the groundnut oil in a heavy-based saucepan. 
1. Add the onions and sweat gently for 5 minutes, stirring with a wooden spoon. 
1. Add the peppers and sweat, stirring for another 5 minutes. 
1. Add the sugar and cook until the vegetables are lightly caramelised, stirring all the time.
1. Pour in the wine vinegar, stirring to deglaze the pan, and let bubble over a medium heat until the liquid has been reduced by two-thirds. 
1. Add the stock and cook until the sauce is reduced and lightly coats the back of a spoon. 
1. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
1. Serve this sauce tepid or cold.

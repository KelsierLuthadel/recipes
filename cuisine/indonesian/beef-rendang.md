# Beef Rendang

![Name](resources/beef-rengang.jpg)

*Rendang is a spicy meat dish which originated from the Minangkabau ethnic group of Indonesia, and is now commonly served across the country. One of the characteristic foods of Minangkabau culture, it is served at ceremonial occasions and to honour guests*

*For the tamarind water, all you do is soak 60 grams of pulp in 125 ml of hot water and leave for 5 minutes.  Break up the pulp with your fingers and then strain the syrupy mixture through a fine-meshed conical sieve discarding the fibrous material and seeds.*

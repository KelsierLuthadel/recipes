# Burger buns

![Name](resources/buns.jpg)

*These golden topped burger buns are simple to make, and work especially well when cut in half, toasted and eaten as a steak sandwich. Where most people go wrong is not making the mixture wet enough and so the finished bread ends up too doughy and dry. Once the water is added, don't flood the work surface with flour as it will unbalance the recipe, instead, use olive oil if need be.*

![Lamb stock (Fond d'agneau)](resources/Lamb-stock.png)

*This stock is light in both flavour and appearance. It can be used for deglazing in many roast or pan fried-lamb recipes.*

**Yield:** 1 litre

## Ingredients
- 150 grams carrots (cut into rounds)
- 100 grams onions (coarsely chopped)
- 250 ml white wine
- 4 tomatoes (peeled, de-seeded and chopped)
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 Bouquet garni
- 1 stalk celery (chopped)
- 2 sprigs tarragon
- 6 peppercorns (crushed)


## Method
1. Preheat the oven to 220Â°c. 
1. Cut the lamb into pieces and place in a roasting pan.
1. Brown in the hot oven, turning the pieces over from time to time with a slotted spoon, for about 20 minutes. 
1. When the lamb has coloured, add the carrots and onions, mix together and cook for another 5 minutes.
1. Using the slotted spoon, transfer the contents of the roasting pan to a large saucepan. 
1. Pour off the fat from the roasting pan, deglaze with the white wine and reduce by half.
1. Pour the reduced wine into the pan, add 2.5 litres of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat. 
1. As soon as the liquid boils, reduce the heat so that the surface is barely trembling. 
1. Simmer for 10 minutes, skim and add all the other ingredients.
1. Simmer, uncovered, for 1 1/2 hours, skimming the surface as necessary. 
1. Strain the stock through a fine-meshed conical sieve into a bowl and cool over ice.

![Name](resources/beignets.jpg)

*Light with just a hint of crunch as you bite into them, these beignets are lovely with a jug of red berry coulis on the side.*

**Serves:** 6 - 8

## Ingredients
### For the Batter
- 7 grams fresh yeast
- 75 ml milk
- 130 grams plain flour
- pinch of salt
- 60 ml light beer
- 1 egg (separated)
- 2 tablespoons groundnut oil
- 20 grams caster sugar

### To cook and serve
- grapeseed oil (to deep fry)
- 500 grams mixed red fruits
- granulated sugar

## Method
### To make the batter
1. In a small bowl, whisk the yeast into one-third of the milk.
1. Put the flour and salt into a large bowl and slowly pour in the rest of the milk, the beer and egg yolk, mixing continuously with a balloon whisk.
1. Once the mixture is smooth, add the yeast and milk mixture with the groundnut oil.
1. Mix to combine, then cover the bowl with cling film and leave to stand for at least 2 hours.
1. When almost ready to serve, in a clean bowl, whisk the egg white with the 20 grams of sugar to firm peaks.
1. Folk the egg white into the batter, without overworking.

### To cook
1. Heat the grapeseed oil in a heavy pan to 160 - 170 °C.
1. To test the consistency of the batter, using a fork, dip a single fruit into it to coat then immerse in the hot oil and deep-fry for 1½ - 2 minutes. Using a slitted spoon, remove and drain on kitchen paper. Cut the beignet in half; if the coating appears to be too thick, add ½ - 1 tablespoon of milk to the batter.
1. Deep fry 6 - 8 individual fruits at a time, dripping each first in the batter before adding to the oil and cooking for 1½ - 2 minutes, until golden.
1. Remove to a tray lined with kitchen paper to drain; keep warm while you deep-fry the remaining beignets.
1. As soon as they are all cooked, sprinkle the beignets with a little sugar and serve.

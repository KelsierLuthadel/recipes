*Spinach has often been regarded with disdain in the West, probably because it is often overcooked. This is a time-honoured, delicious southern Chinese recipe. The spinach is quickly stir-fried and then seasoned. It is very simple to prepare and tastes divine.*

## Ingredients
- 700 grams fresh spinach
- 1 tablespoon oil

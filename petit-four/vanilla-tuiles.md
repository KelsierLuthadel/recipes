**Prep Time:** 25 minutes
**Cooking Time:** 8 minutes
**Yield:** 12

## Ingredients
- 110 grams butter, softened
- 120 grams icing sugar sugar
- 4 egg whites
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 145 grams self-raising flour

## Method
1. In a bowl, cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg whites, one at a time. 
1. Beat in the vanilla.
1. If you're using an electric beater, switch to low speed, then add the flour until just combined. Do not over-mix. 
1. Cover and chill for at least 1 hour.
1. Preheat oven to 170Â°C.
1. Cut a small hole (about 7 cm diameter) in a thin piece of cardboard or plastic to serve as a stencil in forming the tuiles.
1. Line a baking tray with non-stick baking paper and place the stencil on it. 
1. Using a spatula, place a small amount of the batter in the centre of the hole of the stencil and spread it out evenly. 
1. Carefully lift the stencil off. Repeat until dough is used up.
1. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until lightly brown around the edges. 
1. While still hot, use a spatula to remove them from the tray and place them over a rolling pin or glass jar. 
1. Allow each one to harden and cool.

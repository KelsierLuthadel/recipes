# Kung pao chicken

![Name](resources/kung-pao.jpg)

*This hot and spicy chicken dish can easily be made ahead of time and re-heated. It is a good example of contrasting flavours which characterise the spicy cuisine of western China. The finished dish smells wonderfully fragrant and has an equally delightful taste.*

**Serves:** 4

## Ingredients
- 350 grams chicken pieces
- ½ teaspoon salt

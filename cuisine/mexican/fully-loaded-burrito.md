# Fully Loaded Burrito
*The fully loaded burrito is where all of your hard work and efforts come together to repay you in full – packed with your choice of seasoned meat or vegetables, flavourful rice, smooth and filling beans, cheese, salsa and more, it’s an entire meal wrapped up to go.*

**Serves:** 1

## Ingredients
- 1 extra-large flour tortilla
- 1–2 tablespoons Refried Pinto Beans (page 187, or from a tin)
- 1 portion cooked pork, beef, chicken, vegetables or beans, as desired
- 1 portion Spiced Rice (page 182)
- 1 portion Fresh Tomato Salsa (page 16)
- 1 handful grated cheese (Cheddar, Monterey Jack, mozzarella, or a mix of all three)
- 1 tablespoon sour cream

## Method
1. Preheat the oven to its lowest setting (or the ‘keep warm’ setting if your oven has one).

1. Heat a dry frying pan over a medium heat. Add the flour tortilla and warm for 15 seconds on each side. Place the warmed tortilla onto a large piece of tinfoil on a work surface.

### Build
1. Spread the refried beans over the warm tortilla. 
1. Top the bottom half of the tortilla with the pork, beef, chicken, vegetables or beans, spiced rice, fresh tomato salsa, grated cheese and sour cream. 
1. Lift the bottom third of the tortilla over the fillings, fold in the left- and right-hand side of the tortilla and continue rolling tightly towards the top until a wrap is formed.
1. Wrap it up in the foil and put the burrito into the warm oven to heat through for 1–2 minutes. Serve with your favourite salsas on the side.

*Variation*
Stuffed crust burrito: make the burrito as per the instructions in the previous recipe, on page 148, then proceed as described above.

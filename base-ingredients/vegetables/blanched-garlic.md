# Blanched garlic

*Blanching garlic in milk gives it a mild, sweet and slightly nutty character. Blanched garlic works especially well with vegetables, such as green beans that have been fried in butter.*

1. Peel and de-germ the garlic cloves. 
1. Put the garlic in a heavy-based saucepan, and cover with milk.
1. Slowly bring the milk to a boil, over a medium heat.
1. As soon as the milk begins to boil, strain the garlic into a sieve, discarding the milk.
1. Gently rinse the garlic with cold water and return to the pan, covering the garlic with fresh milk.
1. Repeat this process three more times.

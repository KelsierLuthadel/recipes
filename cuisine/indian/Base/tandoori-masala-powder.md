# Tandoori Masala Powder

*Most commercial tandoori masalas taste fantastic because they are loaded with salt and tangy citric acid powder. The spices used are usually quite cheap, like ground coriander and cumin, and they are made more visually appealing with the use of red food colouring.*


## Ingredients
- 3 tbsp coriander seeds 
- 3 tbsp cumin seeds 
- 1 tbsp black mustard seeds 
- 5cm (2in) piece of cinnamon stick or cassia bark 
- Small piece of mace 
- 3 dried Indian bay leaves (cassia leaves) 
- 1 tbsp ground ginger 
- 2 tbsp finely ground garlic powder 
- 2 tbsp dried onion powder 
- 2 tbsp amchoor (dried mango powder) 
- 1 tbsp (or more) red food colouring powder (optional)

## Method
1. Roast the whole spices in a dry frying pan over a medium-high heat until warm to the touch and fragrant, moving them around in the pan as they roast and being careful not to burn them. 
1. Tip onto a plate to cool. 
1. Grind to a fine powder in a spice grinder or pestle and mortar and tip into a bowl. 
1. Stir in the ground ginger, garlic powder, onion powder and amchoor. 
1. Stir in the red food colouring powder (if using). 
1. Store in an airtight container in a cool, dark place and use as required, within 2 months for optimal flavour.

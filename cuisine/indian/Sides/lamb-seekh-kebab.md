![Name](resources/seekh-kebab.png)

**Serves:** 4

## Ingredients
- 1kg lean minced lamb 
- 1 egg 
- 2 tbsp finely chopped green chillis
- 2 onions (finely chopped)
- 1 tbsp freshly roasted ground coriander
- 1 tbsp garam masala (see p14) 
- Large bunch of coriander (finely chopped)
- 1 tsp salt 

## Method
1. Place the lamb mince in a large bowl. 
1. Mix in the remaining ingredients and begin kneading the mixture with your hands. 
1. When all the ingredients are nicely mixed, begin pressing down on the meat, scraping it against the bottom of the bowl. 
1. The meat should streak against the bottom of the bowl, giving a ‘lace’ texture (see above), which will take about 5 minutes of kneading. 
1. Form the mixture into meatballs the size of tennis balls. 
1. Slide a meatball onto a large, flat skewer and squeeze with a wet hand into a sausage shape around the skewer. 
1. Turn the skewer over and do the same, squeezing again with your hand to make it longer. 
1. Continue this process until you have a long kebab with visible finger marks that is securely on the skewer. 
1. Repeat with the rest of the meat mixture. 
1. Heat your barbecue using the direct heat method then place the kebabs over the heat. 
1. Char well on one side then flip them over and do the same on the other side.

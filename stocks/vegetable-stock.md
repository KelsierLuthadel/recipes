![Vegetable stock (Fond de légumes)](resources//Vegetable-stock.png

*This has a light subtle taste, and can be used as the base for most gravy based sauces if desired. Boiling this stock extremely slowly will result in a light clear stock rather than a cloudy colour.*

**Yield:** 1.5 litres

- 2 leeks (white part only, thinly sliced)

1. Add the potato slices and season with salt and pepper.
1. Season the tuna with salt and pepper and grill or shallow fry for about 1 - 1 ½ minutes on each side, keeping the tuna medium to medium - rare.
1. While the tuna is cooking, mix the salad dressing with the chopped herbs and hard boiled egg.
1. Pour some over the salad and toss together with the toasts.
1. Divide between the plate and sit the tuna on top.

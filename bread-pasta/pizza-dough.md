# Pizza dough

![Pizza dough](resources/pizza.jpg)

*A classic pizza dough, this dough is best when the finished base is made at least half an hour in advance to give it time to dry out. Prick the finished base with a fork a few times to allow the air to help cook the dough. Cheese can be added around the edge of the base, and wrapped into a stuffed crust.*

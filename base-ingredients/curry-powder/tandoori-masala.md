# Tandoori masala

![Tandoori Masala](resources/tandoori-masala.jpg)

*As with all pre-mixed masalas, this has the advantage of maturing during storage. Keep it in the dark in an airtight container, and it will keep for about 12 months.*

*The bright reds and oranges that are often associated with restaurant tandoooris and tikkas are phoney, requiring chemical colourings. Instead it is much better and healthier to use beetroot and annatto seed powders. If these are unavailable, then a teaspoon of red and half a teaspoon of sunset yellow food colouring could be used instead.*

**Note:** spoon measurements here are heaped, rather than level.

**Yield:** 200 grams

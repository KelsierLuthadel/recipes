*These are lovely as they are, or coated in chocolate - simply dip in melted chocolate one by one using a small fork.*

**Yield:** 20

## Ingredients
-  3 grapefruit (or 6 oranges)
- 600 grams caster sugar
- 75 grams granulated sugar (to coat) 

## Method
1. Using a sharp, flexible knife, cut a 5 mm slice from the base of each fruit. 
1. Starting at the top and following the contour of the fruit towards the vase, cut 7 strips of peel, including the white pith, 3 cm wide, from each grapefruit, or 5 strips from each orange.
1. Cut each strip into baton shapes, 1 cm wide.
1. Put these strips of citrus peel into a saucepan, cover with cold water and bring to the boil.
1. Drain and refresh with cold water, then drain again. 
1. Repeat this procedure 4 times.
1. Dissolve the caster sugar in 450 ml of water in another saucepan over a low heat.
1. Bring slightly to the boil and skim the surface if necessary. 
1. Immerse the blanched strips of peel in the syrup and poach at a bare simmer for 2 hours for the orange, or 3 hours for grapefruit.
1. Leave the strips to cool in the syrup until warm, then drain and place on a wire rah to finish cooling, keeping them apart. 
1. Finally, roll in the granulated sugar to coat. Store in an airtight container in the fridge until ready to serve, interleaved with parchment to stop them sticking together.

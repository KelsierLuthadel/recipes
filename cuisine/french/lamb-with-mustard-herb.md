# Breast of lamb with a mustard and herb crust

![Name](resources/lamb-herb.jpg)

*Breast of lamb is a cut of meat taken from the belly. Although this is a relatively cheap cut of meat, it is packed with flavour.*

*Make sure the lamb has been skinned, boned and any excess fat has been removed. Any bones can always be added to the stock during cooking to increase the lamb flavour.*

**Serves:** 4

### To make the crust

1. Gradually spoon some of the shallot butter into the crumbs, mixing all the time.
1. The mix will be ready when it holds once pressed together, but it should still stay free flowing.

### To cook  the lamb breasts
1. Heat a frying pan and colour the lamb breasts in the fat or oil.
1. Melt half the butter in a braising pan and fry the garlic, herbs and vegetables slowly for a few minutes.

### To crust the lamb

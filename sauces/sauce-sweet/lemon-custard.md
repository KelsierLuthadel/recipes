*Served with red fruits, this sharp lemony custard makes the perfect summer dessert. To accentuate the flavour, sprinkle on some shreds of candied lemon zest just before serving.*

**Servings:** 4

## Ingredients
- 240 ml single cream
- 140 grams caster sugar (plus extra if the lemons are very tart)
- 240 ml lemon juice (about 6 lemons)
- 6 egg yolks

## Method
1. Combine the cream, 60 grams of sugar and the lemon juice in a saucepan and slowly bring to the boil over a low heat.
1. Meanwhile, in a bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the remaining 80 grams of sugar to a ribbon consistency. 
1. Pour the boiling cream on to the egg mixture, whisking continuously.
1. Pour the custard back into the saucepan and cook very gently for 2 minutes, stirring continuously with a wooden spoon or spatula; don't let it boil or it will curdle.
1. Pass the custard through a fine-meshed conical sieve into a chilled bowl.
1. Leave to cool, stirring occasionally to prevent a skin from forming. 
1. When the custard is cold, cover the bowl with cling film and refrigerate until ready to serve.

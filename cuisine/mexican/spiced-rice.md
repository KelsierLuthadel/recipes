# Spiced Rice
*The combination of spices and tomato gives this rice its distinctive yellow-orange hue.*

**Serves:** 4

## Ingredients
- 1 teaspoon cumin powder
- ¼ teaspoon smoked paprika
- Pinch of cayenne pepper
- Pinch of Mexican oregano
- ¼ teaspoon sea salt, or to taste
- Pinch of black pepper
- 150g long-grain rice
- 2 teaspoons olive oil
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 1 garlic clove, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon Pickled Jalapeños (page 41, or from a jar), drained and finely chopped
- 100ml tomato passata
- 100ml Light Chicken Stock (page 3) or vegetable stock

## Method
### Preparing the rice
1. Put the cumin powder, smoked paprika, cayenne pepper, Mexican oregano, sea salt and black pepper in a bowl. Mix briefly and set aside.
1. Put the long-grain rice in a bowl and cover with fresh water. 
Mix the rice briefly by hand to agitate it – the water will become cloudy as excess starch is released from the rice. Drain the water and repeat the process twice more until the water is clear. Give the rice a final rinse with water and drain well.
1. Heat the oil in a wok or frying pan over a medium heat. 
1. Add the chopped onion and stir-fry for 2–3 minutes until the onions are softened. 
1. Add the chopped garlic and jalapeños and stir-fry for a further 30 seconds. 
1. Add the prepared spices, mix well and fry for 30–40 seconds.
1. Add the rice and mix thoroughly until fully incorporated with the spices.

### Cooking the rice
1. Pour into a pot, add the tomato passata and stock, mixing briefly to combine with the rice. 
1. Add a little more water or stock if necessary until the liquid reaches the first knuckle of your index finger when you touch the rice.
1. Place on the hob over a high heat. As soon as the rice begins to boil, cover the pot with a lid and reduce the heat to low. 
1. Cook for 12 minutes. Set the rice aside (don’t open the lid) and let it rest for 20 minutes. Mix the rice well and serve.

**Notes**
Chill any leftover rice as quickly as possible and store in the fridge for up to 2 days. The rice can be reheated in the microwave (put the rice and a splash of water in a microwave-safe bowl or container, heat on full power for 1½–2 minutes or until piping hot throughout) or can be stir-fried with a touch of oil over a medium-high heat for 2–3 minutes.

![Borek](resources/borek.jpg)

*The khandrajo filling is an aubergine, onion and tomato mixture a little bit like a ratatouille.* 

*Make the khandrajo mixture first, so that it has time to cool completely before filling the börek.*

**Makes:** 20 börek

**Preparation time**
- 1 hour 15 minutes
- 40 cooking time

## Ingredients

### Filling 
- 1 large onion (finely chopped)
- 30 ml groundnut oil
- 2 large aubergines
- salt and pepper (to taste)
- 400 grams tinned tomatoes (chopped)

### Pastry
- 50 grams butter
- 60 ml water
- 60 ml olive oil
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 250 grams flour

### To glaze
- eggwash (1 egg yolk mixed with 1 tablespoon milk)
- sesame seeds

## Method

### For the filling
1. Wash and dry the aubergines, and cut into 3 cm cubes.
1. Drain the tomatoes, reserving the liquid.
1. Heat a karahi or wok over a medium heat and add a tablespoon of oil.
1. Add the onion, and stir fry until the onion becomes translucent.
1. Add the aubergine with salt and pepper, stirring.
1. When the onion and aubergine darkens, add the tomatoes and stir thoroughly.
1. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally for about 20 minutes.
1. Increase the heat to hight and stir constantly until the mixture becomes fairly dry. If the mixture sticks to the pan, add a little of the reserved tomato liquid and scrape well.
1. When the mixture becomes really dry, transfer it to a bowl to cool. This mixture must be absolutely cold before you can use it.
1. Skim any oil that rises to the surface of the khandrajo.

### For the pastry
1. Cut up the butter and melt it gently over a low heat, making sure it does not cook.
1. Pour the butter into a large mixing bowl, along with the oil and the water.
1. Add the salt and stir well to combine.
1. Using a large wooden spoon, add one spoonful of flour at a time, stirring constantly.
1. Mix until the dough comes away from the sides of the bowl.
1. If the mixture is too wet, add a little flour, mixing as you go until the dough is homogeneous.
1. Put the pastry on a delicately floured surface and knead for 10 seconds and then cover with cling-film and allow to rest in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.

### To make the börek
1. Preheat the oven to 190°C.
1. Take a piece of dough about the size of an egg and press it into a flat disc in your hand, ensuring that there are no cracks in the pastry.
1. Flatten it out further on a board and roll it into a thin circle.
1. Put about 1 teaspoon of filling just off the centre of the pastry.
1. Fold the pastry over the filling to make a semicircle, and press all around with your thumb to seal.
1. Trim the edges of the seam with a pastry cutter.
1. Using a fork, make indentations along the edge of the seam or crimp with your fingers and thumb.
1. Brush the börek with an eggwash and place on a baking sheet.
1. Scatter some sesame seeds over the börek and bake for about 30 to 40 minutes.
1. Transfer to a cooling rack and serve warm or cold.

# Steamed Rice

![Name](resources/)

*Never fill your pan more than one-third full or the rice will not cook correctly. If making a larger batch, remember the uncooked rice-to-water volume (not weight) ratio is always 1 measure of rice to 1 1/2 water.*

**Serves:** 4

## Ingredients
- 370g (2 cups) basmati rice 
- 750ml (3 cups) cold water 
- Pinch of salt 
- 1 tbsp ghee or butter

## Method
1. Rinse and soak the rice as above, then drain. 
1. Place the rice, water, salt and ghee or butter in a saucepan. 
1. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and bring to a boil over a high heat. As soon as the water boils, remove from the heat and let it sit, lid on, for 40 minutes. 
1. Donâ€™t remove the lid. 
1. After 40 minutes, your rice will be perfectly done. 
1. Using a fork or chopstick, separate the rice grains, stirring very slowly.

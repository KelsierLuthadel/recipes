![Name](resources/meringue-italienne.png)

*This meringue has a soft, rich velvet texture and is perfect for covering tartlets.*

## Ingredients
- 80 ml water
- 360 grams sugar
- 30 grams glucose (optional)
- 6 egg whites

## Method
1. Pour the water in a heavy bottomed pan, then add the sugar and glucose, if using. 
1. Place over a moderate heat and stir the mixture with a skimmer until it boils. 
1. Skim the surface and wash down the sugar crystals which form inside the pan with a brush dipped in cold water. 
1. Now increase the heat so that the syrup cooks rapidly. 
1. Insert a sugar thermometer to check the temperature.
1. When the sugar reaches 100°C, beat the egg whites in an electric mixer until stiff. 
1. Keep an eye on the sugar and take the pan off the heat when it reaches 121°C
1. When the egg whites are well risen and firm, set the mixer to the lowest speed and gently pour on the cooked sugar in a thin stream, taking care not to let it run on to the whisks. 
1. Continue to beat at a low speed until the mixture is almost completely cold; this will take about 15 minutes. 
1. The meringue is now ready to use.

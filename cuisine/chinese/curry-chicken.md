![Name](resources/chinese-chicken-curry.jpg)

*Curry blends well with chicken especially when used in the style of southern Chinese cuisine, namely as a light and subtle sauce which does not overpower the delicate chicken meat.*

**Serves:** 4

## Ingredients
- 225 grams chicken breasts (skinned)
- 1 egg white
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon cornflour
- 225 grams green peppers (de-seeded)

1. Cut the peppers into 2 cm cubes.
1. Heat the oil in a wok or large frying pan until it is moderately hot.

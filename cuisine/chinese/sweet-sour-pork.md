# Sweet and sour pork

![Name](resources/sweet-sour-pork.jpg)

*Of all Chinese dishes, sweet and sour pork is probably one of the best known in the west. Unfortunately for Westerns it is rarely properly made, often consisting of heavy, doughy balls containing a scrap of pork drenched in a sweet, red sauce. Properly prepared, sweet and sour Chinese dishes are so delicately balanced that one is hard pressed to describe them as either strictly sweet or sour.*

*This dish is best served with plain steamed rice and a simple blanched vegetable such as Bok Choi in soy sauce.*

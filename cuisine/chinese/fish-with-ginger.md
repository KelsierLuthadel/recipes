# Fried fish with ginger

![Name](resources/fish-ginger.jpg)

*Ginger goes very well with fish. It is used rather as lemon is in European fish cookery. In this easy dish it imparts a subtle fragrance to the dish.*

**Serves:** 4

## Ingredients
- 225 grams cod fillets
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1½ tablespoons cornflour
- 75 ml groundnut oil
- 1½ tablespoons fresh ginger (finely shredded)
- 1 tablespoon Chinese chicken stock
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon dry sherry or rice wine
- 1 teaspoon sugar

## Method
1. Sprinkle the fish fillets on both sides with the ¼ teaspoon of salt.
1. Cut the fish into 2 cm wide strips and let these sit for 20 minutes before dusting with the cornflour.
1. Heat the oil in a wok or large frying pan.
1. When it is hot add the ginger and, a few seconds later, the fish.
1. Shallow fry the fish strips until they are crisp and brown.
1. Remove them with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.
1. Pour off all the oil and discard it.
1. Wipe the wok or pan clean and then add to it the rest of the ingredients.
1. Bring them to the boil and then return the fish slices to the pan and coat them with the sauce.
1. Turn the fish gently in the sauce for 1 minute, taking care not to break up the slices.
1. Remove to a platter and serve at once.

# Fiery Beef Burrito
*The combination of already flavourful spiced beef with the particularly fiery salsa makes this burrito a force to be reckoned with!*

**Serves:** 1

## Ingredients
- 1 portion cooked Spiced Minced Beef (page 102)
- 1 extra-large flour tortilla
- 1 portion Spiced Rice (page 182)
- 1 handful Fried Tortilla Chips (page 14, or from a packet), lightly - crushed
- ½ portion (about 40ml) Nacho Cheese Sauce (page 34)
- 2 tablespoons Chile De Árbol Red Salsa (page 30)
- 1 tablespoon sour cream

## Method
1. Heat the oven to its lowest setting, or to ‘keep warm’ if your oven has that mode.

1. Heat one portion of spiced minced beef in a pot over a medium heat for 2–3 minutes or until sizzling and piping hot.

1. Heat a dry frying pan over a medium heat. Add the flour tortilla and warm for 15 seconds on each side. 
1. Place the warmed tortilla onto a large piece of tinfoil on a work surface.

### Build
1. Top the bottom half of the tortilla with the spiced beef, spiced rice, lightly crushed tortilla chips, nacho cheese sauce, salsa and sour cream. 
1. Lift the bottom third of the tortilla over the fillings, fold in the left- and right-hand side of the tortilla and continue rolling tightly towards the top until the wrap is formed.
1. Wrap it up in the kitchen foil and put the burrito into the warm oven to heat through for 1–2 minutes. Serve with your favourite salsas on the side.

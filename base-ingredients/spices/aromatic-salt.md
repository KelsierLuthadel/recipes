# Aromatic salt

![Aromatic salt](resources/aromatic-salt.jpg)

*A lot of Balti recipes call for aromatic salt, which is a blend of light spice mixture with sea salt. Ordinarily salt can be used in its place, but the spicing adds a delicacy and subtlety to a recipe.*

*What follows are two salt recipes, the first being light and aromatic, the second containing spicier tastes as well as nuts.*

*The salt should be stored in screw top container away from bright light.

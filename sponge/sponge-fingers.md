![Sponge fingers](resources/)

*Sponge biscuits are used as a base for numerous desserts, like Swiss roll. They can be served filled with Crème Chantilly or as decorative pieces.*

**Serves:** 

## Ingredients
- 6 eggs (separate out yolks)
- 180 grams flour (sifted)
- 190 grams sugar (sifted)
- 30 grams icing sugar (sifted)

## Method
1. Preheat the oven to 220°C
1. Combine all of the egg yolks with two-thirds of the sugar, and beat until they form a ribbon.
1. Beat the egg whites in a mixer until they are well risen, then add the remaining sugar and beat at high speed for 1 minute until firm.
1. Using a flat slotted spoon, fold about one-third of the whites into the yolks until the mixture is perfectly blended. 
1. Tip in the remaining whites all at once and fold them very gently into the mixture. 
1. Before it is thoroughly blended, still mixing continuously, scatter in the flour. 
1. As soon as the mixture is homogeneous, stop mixing, or it will become heavy.
1. With a piping bag fitted with a 1.5 cm nozzle, pipe out 'fingers' about 10 cm long onto baking parchment or lightly buttered and floured greaseproof paper. 
1. Lightly dust them twice with icing sugar, at 5 minute intervals. 
1. Bake in the oven for about 8-10 minutes. Before the sponge fingers have cooled completely, lift them off the paper with a palette knife and place on a wire rack.

# Pâte sablée (Shortbread dough)

![Name](resources/shortbread.png)

*Flour is always the last ingredient to be added to pâte sablée, so that the dough remains crumbly or 'short'.* 

*Once you have added the flour, do not overwork the dough, or it will become too elastic.*

*This recipe is very delicate; if you are using the dough to line a flan tin or to make sablés, you must work very fast, without over-handling the dough, as it softens extremely quickly.*

*Rolled out and cut into different shapes, this dough is perfect for petits fours secs.*

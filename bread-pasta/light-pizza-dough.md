# Light pizza dough

![Light pizza dough](resources/pizzadough.jpg)

*This dough makes a perfect light base for any pizza. The extra effort needed to make this fine dough is worth every second, as the resulting pizza is light and airy. This dough is best cooked in a non fan-assisted oven.*

*When kneading, it is tempting to add more flour to stop the dough from sticking to your hands or the table. You must not add more flour as this will make the resulting pizza to heavy. If the dough is sticking too much, add a little olive oil to your hands and rub over the dough.*

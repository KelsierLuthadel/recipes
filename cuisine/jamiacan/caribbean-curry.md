# Caribbean chicken curry stew

![Name](resources/carribean-curry.png)

*In many Caribbean stew dishes there is an initial step of burning sugar in oil which is used to brown the meat in. This adds a very unique sweetness to the stews from this region and this sweetness paired with the unmistakable flavour (and heat) from the wonderful scotch bonnet chilli is simply astounding. I have used curry powder in this - yes curry powder! and I cannot tell you how much I love the flavour of this very simple, yet fragrant and delicious curry.*

*The flavour that the scotch bonnet gives is unmistakable and it is THE chilli of this region. It's used in pepper sauces as well as infamous Jerk chicken - it is not a chilli for the faint hearted. It reaches between 100,000 to 350,000 on the Scoville heat scale. It's fruity heat penetrates into stews and the meat so please be mindful and take it out of the stew once you think its hot enough for you.*

*The second point on this is that you would usually marinade the chicken with what is known as 'green seasoning'. This is a blend of specific ingredients that adds flavour and tenderises.*

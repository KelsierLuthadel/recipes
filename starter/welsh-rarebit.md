# Welsh rarebit

![Welsh rarebit](resources/rarebit.jpg)

*This succulent, mouth watering rarebit is perfect spread on lightly buttered toast and then cooked under a hot grill for a few minutes, until browned and bubbling. It is also delightful spread over smoked haddock, and coloured under a grill, the haddock will then need to be finished in a pre-heated oven (180Â°C) for 3 - 4 minutes.*

**Serves:** 16

## Ingredients
- 700 grams mature Cheddar (grated)
- 150 ml milk
- 25 grams plain flour
- 50 grams fresh white breadcrumbs
- 1 tablespoon English mustard powder
- half teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- salt and freshly ground white pepper
- 2 eggs
- 2 egg yolks

## Method
1. Put the Cheddar into a pan and add the milk.
1. Slowly melt them together over a low heat, but do not allow the mixture to boil as this will separate the cheese.
1. When the mixture is smooth and just begins to bubble, add the flour, breadcrumbs and mustard and cook for a few minutes, stirring over a low heat, until the mixture comes away from the sides of the pan and begins to form a small ball shape.
1. Add the Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper and leave to cool.
1. When cold, transfer to a food processor and add the eggs and egg yolks, and process until combined.
1. When the eggs are mixed in, chill for a few hours before using.
1. After it has rested in the fridge, you will find the rarebit is very easy to handle.

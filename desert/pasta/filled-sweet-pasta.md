**Serves:** 6 - 8

## Ingredients
### For the sweet pasta
- 3 whole eggs 
- 2 egg yolks
- 300 grams plain flour (plus extra for dusting)
- 50 grams butter (softened)
- 4 tablespoons Amaretto liqueur
- 1 litre vegetable oil (for frying)
- icing sugar (for dusting)

### For the filling
- 40 grams caster sugar
- 250 grams ricotta cheese
- zest of 1 orange (finely chopped)
- 10 almonds (finely chopped)
- 40 grams candied fruit (finely chopped)

## Method
1. Beat 2 of the eggs in a bowl and set aside.
1. To make the sweet pasta dough, place the remaining 1 egg and 2 egg yolks in a food processor. Add the flour, butter and Amaretto and mix together. Turn out the mixture onto a well-floured surface and knead for 2 minutes until you have a soft dough. Cover with fling film and place in the fridge to rest for 30 minutes.
1. To prepare the filling, place all the ingredients in a medium bowl and mix together with a fork. Place in the fridge to rest for 10 minutes.
1. Flatten the prepared pasta dough with a rolling pin so that it can fit through the rollers of a pasta machine. 
1. Flour the pasta on both sides and start to roll it from the widest setting to the thinnest. 
1. Make sure you keep the pasta well floured at all times. Lay the pasta sheets on a well-floured surface. 
1. Cut the pasta into discs using an 8 cm cutter (you should get about 30 discs).
1. Place about a teaspoonful of the filling the middle of each disc, sharing it out equally.
1. Brush the edges of the discs with the beaten egg and fold over to make a half-moon shape. Press down with your fingertips to seal, and then press down with a fork to completely seal and make an impression on the seam.
1. Heat the oil in a large saucepan until hot and smoking.
1. Carefully drop in the sweet-filled pasta and fry for about 15 seconds until golden all over. (Be very careful and work in batches, no more than five mezzelune at a time.)
1. Once cooked, remove the mezzelune using a slotted spoon and place on some kitchen paper to soak up any excess oil.
1. To serve, place all the mezzelune on a large serving dish and dust with plenty of icing sugar. Serve warm with a little glass of Amaretto or Vin Santo.

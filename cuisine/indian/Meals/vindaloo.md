# Vindaloo 

![Vindaloo](resources/vindaloo.jpg)   
*Many restaurants include potato in their vindaloo curries. ‘Aloo’ means potato in Hindi, so a lot of the original self-taught Bangladeshi and Pakistani chefs in the UK mistakenly added potatoes to this fiery curry, and it stuck. Vindaloo, however, owes its origins to Portuguese- controlled Goa in the 15th century, where the dish was usually served with pork.*

**Note**: The recipe here calls for Indian Bay leaf, which has a subtle cinnamon and clove taste, and less woody than the European counterpart.

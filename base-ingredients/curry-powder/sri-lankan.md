# Sri Lankan curry powder

![Sri Lankan](resources/sri-lankan.jpg)

*This curry powder has completely different characteristics from Indian variants. The spices are roasted separately, and chilli powder is used instead of whole dried chillies. The result is a rich, dark curry powder that is idea for dish, poultry, meat and vegetable curries.*

*In Sri Lanka, coriander, cumin, fennel and fenugreek seeds are roasted separately before being combined with roasted cinnamon, cloves and cardamom seeds. After grinding, chilli powder is stirred into the mixture, which is aromatic rather than fiery. Colour and presentation are key features in Sri Lankan cuisine, and you will often find red, yellow and even black curries artistically arranged around a central bowl of rice.*

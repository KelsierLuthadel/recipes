# Fried Onions / Onion Paste

*It’s no secret that fried onions taste amazing. They are an essential ingredient for dopiaza curries and biryanis and also work well in marinades.*
*Don’t throw the cooking oil out. Use it in your curries instead of plain oil*

## Ingredients
- Rapeseed oil, for deep-frying 
- 2 large onions, finely sliced 

## Method
1. Heat enough oil for deep-frying in a large, heavy-based pan over a high heat. 
1. Test to see if it is hot enough by dropping a piece of onion in the oil; if it sizzles immediately and floats to the top, the oil is ready. 
1. Add the sliced onions and fry until they turn light brown, about 5 minutes. 
1. They will continue to cook once out of the oil so be sure to get them out when they are still light brown in colour. 
1. Using a wire mesh spoon, remove the fried onions to a plate lined with kitchen paper, to soak up the excess fat. 

### To make the paste
1. Once cool, add a little water or yoghurt and blend to a paste.

- 50 ml  groundnut oil
- 400 grams onions (thinly sliced)

## Method
1. Heat the groundnut oil in a heavy-based saucepan, add the onions and sweat gently over a low heat for 10 minutes. 
1. Add the sugar, increase the heat slightly and cook until the onions are golden and lightly caramelised, stirring every minute or so with a wooden spoon.
1. Pour in the wine vinegar to deglaze and cook for 3 minutes, then add the remaining ingredients. 
1. Cook, stirring frequently, over a gently heat for 45 minutes until thick. 
1. The chutney is thick enough when a wooden spoon drawn across the bottom of the pan leaves a clear channel for a few seconds.

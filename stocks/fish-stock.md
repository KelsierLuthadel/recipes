*Fish stock is used in various sauces to accompany fish. If it is intended for a red wine sauce, use red rather than white wine*

**Serves:** 2 litres

## Ingredients
- 1.5 kilograms fish bones (and trimmings)
- 50 grams butter
- 2 leeks (white part only, thinly sliced)
- 75 grams onions (thinly sliced)
- 75 grams button mushrooms (thinly sliced)
- 200 ml dry white wine
- 1 Bouquet garni
- 2 slices lemon
- 8 white peppercorns (crushed and tied in muslin)

## Method
1. Rinse the fish bones and trimmings under cold running water, then drain. 
1. Melt the butter in a large saucepan, add the sliced vegetables and sweat over a low heat for a few minutes.
1. Add the fish bones and trimmings and allow to bubble gently for a few moments, then pour in the white wine. 
1. Cook until it has reduced by two-thirds, then add 2.5 litres cold water. 
1. Bring to the boil, lower the heat, skim the surface and add the bouquet garni and lemon slices.
1. Simmer very gently for 25 minutes, skimming if necessary. 
1. About 10 minutes before the end of cooking, add the muslin-wrapped peppercorns.
1. Gently ladle the stock through a fine-meshed conical sieve into a bowl and cool over ice.

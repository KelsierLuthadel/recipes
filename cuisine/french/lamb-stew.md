# Lamb stew (Navarin d'agneau)

![Name](resources/navarin-d-agneau.jpg)

*The French name for this stew, navarin almost certainly comes from the word for turnip, navet, thought today it is made with potatoes not turnips. You can divide these quantities by 2 to make a stew for 4, but this dish is best made in larger quantities.*

*The meat is best when it has been cut into 5 cm cubes.*
